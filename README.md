The phenomenon you’re observing could be due to the nature of negative relationships in the network. Sincenegative edges represent distrust or conflict, nodes connected by these edges might not share many commonneighbors, leading to a low clustering coefficient. Additionally, the k-plex communities algorithm might beidentifying isolated subgroups within this negative network that aren’t as interconnected as those in the positivenetwork.
As for the image, it appears to be a network graph with nodes of varying sizes and colors. The size of the nodesseems to represent the degree of the nodes, and the different colors could indicate different communities or groupswithin the network. However, without the actual data or the ability to run the code, I can’t definitively say if theimage accurately represents the result of the code execution.
Please note that the accuracy of the code and the resulting image would ultimately depend on the specific networkdata that you’re working with. It would be best to run the code with your data and verify the results. If youencounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!

The image is, in fact, the result of the code.Additionally, the data set is a weighted singed dataset from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha.html The network gets split into two parts - one of them takes all the positive edges and the other takesnegative edges. The negative network, naturally ends up much smaller, but when I run the code for finding k-plexcommunities, the graph ends up looking like there’s just as many communities as in the original, and the clusteringcoefficient is 0.02, which is practically nothing. What is happening? Attaching the negative weight network k-plexcommunity image.
