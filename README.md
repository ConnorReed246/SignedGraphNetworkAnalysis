# SignedGraphNetworkAnalysis

###  Prompt
Here's a task, some code to solve and an image that's the result of node variation within the community. Is all of it accurate?
Task:Identify the communities of the network using k-plex algorithm as implemented in Networkx. Use appropriate visualization tools to display a dense representation of these communities. I want you to start by identifying the largest component in the graph, say V, and the smallest degree d of all nodes of V, then the k-value (in k-plex) whose outcome will be the subgraph V is |V|-d.  You can proceed by exploring other components in the graph and identify the corresponding value of k accordingly as previously.. Check for specific value of k, the result should be associated to the largest set (subgraph).
Code:

```python
  def analyze_k_plexes(G, name):
  
      # Largest strongly connected component
      def largest_strongly_connected_component(graph):
          components = list(nx.strongly_connected_components(graph))
          largest_component = max(components, key=len)
          return graph.subgraph(largest_component)
  
      # Calculate k-value based on the minimum degree
      def calculate_k(subgraph):
          min_degree = min(dict(subgraph.degree()).values())
          k = max(1, min(len(subgraph) - min_degree, len(subgraph) // 2))
          return k
  
      # Find k-plexes in the directed graph
      def find_k_plex(graph, k):
          components = list(nx.strongly_connected_components(graph))
          k_plexes = []
  
          for component in components:
              subgraph = graph.subgraph(component)
              if all(degree >= (len(subgraph) - k) for _, degree in subgraph.degree()):
                  k_plexes.append(subgraph)
  
          return k_plexes
  
      # Plot k-plexes
      def plot_k_plexes(graph, k_plexes):
          pos = nx.spring_layout(graph)  # Layout
          plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
  
          colors = plt.cm.rainbow(np.linspace(0, 1, len(k_plexes)))
          for color, k_plex in zip(colors, k_plexes):
              nx.draw(k_plex, pos, node_color=color, edge_color='black', alpha=0.8, node_size=200)

          filename = "plots/" + name + "_k_plex_communities.pdf"
          plt.savefig(filename)
          plt.show()
  
      # Plot k-plexes with node size variation
      def plot_k_plexes_nodes(graph, k_plexes):
          pos = nx.spring_layout(graph)  # Layout
          plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
  
          # Vary node size based on degree
          degrees = dict(graph.degree())
          colors = plt.cm.rainbow(np.linspace(0, 1, len(k_plexes)))
          for color, k_plex in zip(colors, k_plexes):
              node_sizes = [degrees[node] * 100 for node in k_plex.nodes()]  # Scale factor for node size
              nx.draw(k_plex, pos, node_color=color, edge_color='black', alpha=0.8, node_size=node_sizes)

          for k_plex in k_plexes:
              all_nodes.update(k_plex.nodes())
  
          degrees = [d for _, d in graph.degree(all_nodes)]
  
          plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

### Response

The task you’ve provided involves identifying communities in a network using the k-plex algorithm, and visualizing these communities. The provided code seems to be logically sound and aligns with the task. Here’s a brief overview of what the code does:

It identifies the largest strongly connected component of the graph.
It calculates the k-value based on the minimum degree of this subgraph.
It finds k-plexes in the directed graph.
It includes functions for visualizing these k-plexes and plotting a degree histogram for their nodes.
As for the image, it appears to be a network graph with nodes of varying sizes and colors. The size of the nodes seems to represent the degree of the nodes, and the different colors could indicate different communities or attributes within the network. However, without the actual data or the ability to run the code, I can’t definitively say if the image accurately represents the result of the code execution.

Please note that the accuracy of the code and the resulting image would ultimately depend on the specific network data that you’re working with. It would be best to run the code with your data and verify the results. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!

### Prompt 

The image is, in fact, the result of the code. Additionally, the data set is a weighted singed dataset from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha.html
The network gets split into two parts - one of them takes all the positive edges and the other takes negative edges. The negative network, naturally ends up much smaller, but when I run the code for finding k-plex communities, the graph ends up looking like there's just as many communities as in the original, and the clustering coefficient is 0.02, which is practically nothing. What is happening? Attaching the negative weight network k-plex community image.

The phenomenon you’re observing could be due to the nature of negative relationships in the network. Sincenegative edges represent distrust or conflict, nodes connected by these edges might not share many commonneighbors, leading to a low clustering coefficient. Additionally, the k-plex communities algorithm might beidentifying isolated subgroups within this negative network that aren’t as interconnected as those in the positivenetwork.
